\title{Building a magneto-optical trap for rubidium atoms: a practical guide for the intrepid third year}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\section*{Abstract}
Our goal for this project was to develop a procedure by which third-year undergraduate students could
build, test, and experiment with a magneto-optical trap (MOT). We successfully constructed a MOT and
demonstrated its effectiveness, though our setup required the use of expensive and fiddly fibre optic couples.
These were chosen for flexibility; an implementation of the experiment would need only minor modifications
to avoid using these.

This document is intended to be both a reflection of our experiences and a guide for a prospective
third year laboratory experiment. I will first outline some of the arelevant theory for the experiment,
then discuss the experimental procedures required to build the MOT; I will conclude the document with a brief
discussion of our results.

\section{Introduction}
Optical trapping methodologies have their origin in the 1970s, when \cite{ashkin} developed what has become known
as optical tweezers using electromagnetic gradients.
